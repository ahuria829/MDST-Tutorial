These exercises are a mix of Python and Pandas practice. Most should be no more than a few lines of code!

# here is a Python list:
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  
# get a list containing the last 3 elements of a
# Yes, you can just type out [4, 5, 6] but we really want to see you demonstrate you know how to use list slicing in Python
    def last_three_elements(a)
        return a[-3:]
    a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    print(last_three_elements(a))
  
  

# create a list of numbers from 1 to 20
    sample_list = list(range(1,21))
    print(sample_list)

# now get a list with only the even numbers between 1 and 100
# you may or may not make use of the list you made in the last cell
    even_numbers = list(range(2,101,2)
    print(even_numbers)
      

# write a function that takes two numbers as arguments
# and returns the first number divided by the second
    def divide_numbers(num1, num2):
      if num2 == 0:
          print("Error")
      return num1 / num2
      print(divide_numbers)
# fizzbuzz
# you will need to use both iteration and control flow 
# go through all numbers from 1 to 30 in order
# if the number is a multiple of 3, print fizz
# if the number is a multiple of 5, print buzz
# if the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz and NOTHING ELSE
# if the number is neither a multiple of 3 nor a multiple of 5, print the number
    def fizzbuzz():
        for num in range(1, 31):
            if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
                print("fizzbuzz")
            elif num % 3 == 0:
                print("fizz")
            elif num % 5 == 0:
                print("buzz")
            else:
                print(num)
      
# create a dictionary that reflects the following menu pricing (taken from Ahmo's)
# Gyro: $9 
# Burger: $9
# Greek Salad: $8
# Philly Steak: $10
    Ahmo_menu_pricing = {
        "Gyro": 9,
        "Burger": 9,
        "Greek Salad": 8,
        "Philly Steak": 10
    }
    
    print(Ahmo_menu_pricing)

# load in the "starbucks.csv" dataset
# refer to how we read the cereal.csv dataset in the tutorial
    import pandas as pd
    starbucks_data = pd.read_csv('starbucks.csv')
    
# select all rows with more than and including 400 calories
    starbucks_data[starbucks_data["calories"] >= 400 ]

# select all rows whose vitamin c content is higher than the iron content
    starbucks_data[starbucks_data["vitamin c"] > starbucks_data["iron"]]

# create a new column containing the caffeine per calories of each drink
    starbucks_data["caffeine_per_calorie"] = starbucks_data["caffeine"] / starbucks_dara["calories"]

# what is the average calorie across all items?
    starbucks_data["calories"].mean()

# how many different categories of beverages are there?
    print(starbucks_data["beverage_category"].nunique())

# what is the average # calories for each beverage category?
    starbucks_data.groupby(["beverage_category"])["calories"].mean()
